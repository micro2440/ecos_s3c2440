<title>The YAFFS filesystem</title>

<chapter id="yaffs-overview-c">
<title>What is YAFFS?</title>

<para>
YAFFS is a filesystem for NAND flash chips.
</para>

<para>
YAFFS is accessed through the FILEIO package which presents a standard 
POSIX compatible IO interface through which applications use standard 
open(), read(), write() and close() calls.
</para>

<para>
YAFFS is a <emphasis>journalling</emphasis> filesystem 
with <emphasis>wear-levelling</emphasis>. It is 
particularly suited to NAND flash parts, having been
designed with their unique properties in mind.
The use of traditional filesystems (FAT, ext2, etc) which do not have
these features is not recommended on such chips because their design
requires the use of fixed address on the underlying hardware.
Such behaviour causes flash sectors to wear out, the consequence of
which would typically be to cause the whole device to become unbootable.
</para>

<para>
YAFFS also provides a high degree of robustness, which is usually
a requirement of embedded devices.
A power failure or other crash can leave a traditional filesystem
in an inconsistent state which is often difficult to repair,
especially in the field.
</para>

<para>
YAFFS can also be built into RedBoot, which allows you to store
application images on NAND flash and boot them with
RedBoot's usual flexible scripting system.
</para>

<para>
For more information about NAND flash chips,
how they differ from NOR flash parts
and other ways to access them, refer to the documentation for the
<xref linkend="io-nand-overview" endterm="io-nand-short">.
</para>

<chapter id="yaffs-getstarted"><title>Getting started with YAFFS</title>

<sect1 id="yaffs-licensing"><title>Licensing considerations</title>
<para>
Before you can use YAFFS, you must accept its license.
<emphasis>YAFFS is not covered by the standard eCos license.</emphasis>
You will be reminded of your license to use YAFFS when you install it.
</para>

<para>
Most users will only have access to YAFFS under the GNU GPL. 
This costs nothing to license. However this usually means that if you ever
distribute your application,
you must do so under the GPL.
This requires you to publish or otherwise make all of your application,
eCos and everything else you link with it available as source code.
For full details refer to the text of the
<ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html">GPL
(v2)</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
If you cannot accept the restrictions and obligations of the GPL, 
YAFFS for eCos is available under a proprietary license, for a fee.
Details are available on request from
<ulink url="http://www.ecoscentric.com/">eCosCentric</ulink> or
<ulink url="http://www.yaffs.net/yaffs-licences">Aleph One</ulink>.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="yaffs-install"><title>Installation</title>

</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="yaffs-config-build"><title>Configuration and Building</title>
<para>
After installing the EPK, YAFFS is added to your eCos repository
and is configured and built in the normal way.
</para>

<sect2 id="yaffs-pkg-deps"><title>Package dependencies</title>
<para>
To link YAFFS into your application,
add <filename>CYGPKG_FS_YAFFS</filename> to your eCos
configuration in the normal way, either using the eCos Configuration Tool
(<emphasis>Packages</emphasis> dialog on the <emphasis>Build</emphasis>
menu), or the <filename>ecosconfig</filename> command-line tool.</para>

<para>
You will also need to add <filename>CYGPKG_IO_NAND</filename> and 
<filename>CYGPKG_IO_FILEIO</filename> to your configuration if they
are not already present.
Your platform HAL should supply packages for all NAND device(s) present.
</para>

<para>
If you started with a smaller template than <emphasis>default</emphasis>,
you may also need to add some of the following:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><filename>CYGPKG_LIBC_STDLIB</filename></para></listitem>
<listitem><para><filename>CYGPKG_LIBC_STRING</filename> </para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="yaffs-pkg-options"><title>Configuration options</title>
<para>
YAFFS provides a number of package options, including tuning parameters.
</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry><term><constant>CYGSEM_FS_YAFFS_CACHE_SHORT_NAMES</constant></term><listitem><para>If
set, caches files' short names in RAM. This consumes more RAM but
improves performance.</para></listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term><constant>CYGPKG_FS_YAFFS_RET_DIRENT_DTYPE</constant></term><listitem><para>Controls
whether YAFFS supports setting the <structfield>d_type</structfield>
field in a <structname>struct dirent</structname>.  If you don't need
this, leave it switched off to save a little code size.</para></listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term><constant>CYGNUM_FS_YAFFS_RESERVED_BLOCKS</constant></term><listitem><para>
The number of blocks to keep in reserve to allow for garbage collection
and block failures. The recommended value is 5, but it can be tuned to suit your application:
higher numbers can reduce the delay caused by garbage collection, at the cost of removing
available space for storing files.
<emphasis>This setting is a global default and may be
changed by a mount-time option.</emphasis></para></listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term><constant>CYGNUM_FS_YAFFS_SHORTOP_CACHES</constant></term><listitem><para>
The number of page cache entries to use. Values of 10 to 20 are
recommended as a good compromise; increasing the number consumes more RAM but may
improve performance.
Set to 0 to disable these caches altogether. 
<emphasis>This setting is a global default and may be
changed by a mount-time option.</emphasis></para></listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term><constant>CYGNUM_FS_YAFFS_TEMP_BUFFERS</constant></term>
<listitem><para>
YAFFS requires temporary buffers in many places throughout the code.
To avoid the overhead of a dynamic malloc every time, a number of
buffers are preallocated at mount time. This setting controls how many;
should it not prove enough, YAFFS will call maloc on demand as required.
The default setting is 6; most users will not need to change it.
</para></listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term><constant>CYGNUM_FS_YAFFS_TRACEMASK</constant></term><listitem><para>This
is a 32-bit bitfield which controls diagnostic output. The bit definitions
are found in <filename>yportenv.h</filename>; changing this setting tends to only be useful
if you wish to debug YAFFS itself.</para></listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term><constant>CYGPKG_FS_YAFFS_CFLAGS_ADD</constant></term>
<term><constant>CYGPKG_FS_YAFFS_CFLAGS_REMOVE</constant></term><listitem><para>
These settings allow specific build options to be added to or removed from the CFLAGS
list when building YAFFS.</para></listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term><constant>CYGSEM_FS_YAFFS_SMALLPAGE_MODE</constant></term>
<listitem><para>This option only affects behaviour on so-called "small page" NAND devices
(those whose pages are 512 bytes long).
Such devices do not have enough space in their Out Of Band area to
store a full set of YAFFS metadata tags. There are two ways to work
around this: <itemizedlist><listitem><para><constant>YAFFS2</constant> mode -
the default - uses regular tags, but at
a price: it steals 16 bytes from the available space per page to store
them. <emphasis>This reduces the apparent available
size of your filesystem by 1/32!</emphasis></para></listitem>
<listitem><para><constant>YAFFS1</constant> mode places a smaller tagset
in the OOB area, but with a different side-effect: whenever a page is
deleted, one byte of the tags area has to be rewritten.  Some devices
forbid rewrite-without-erase in this way, so it may not be safe for you
to use this option.  <emphasis>You must refer to the spec sheet for the chip on
your board before selecting this option!</emphasis></para></listitem></itemizedlist>
</para></listitem></varlistentry>
<varlistentry><term><constant>CYGSEM_FS_YAFFS_OMIT_YAFFS2_CODE</constant></term><listitem><para>
This causes all YAFFS2 code to be omitted from the build. This option only makes sense when
all the devices on which YAFFS is to be used are small-page and operating in YAFFS1 mode.
<note><para>There is no corresponding option to omit YAFFS1 code, because that code is only
compiled when <constant>CYGSEM_FS_YAFFS_SMALLPAGE_MODE</constant> is set to YAFFS1.  </para></note>
</para></listitem></varlistentry>
</variablelist>
</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="yaffs-using"><title>Using YAFFS</title>
<para>
YAFFS appears in the eCos filesystem table.
This means that you can mount a filesystem in the standard Unix-like way,
then interact with it with calls to open, read, etc.
</para>

<sect2 id="yaffs-mounting"><title>Mounting a filesystem</title>

<para>
Before you can use a filesystem, it must be <emphasis>mounted</emphasis>.
</para>

<para>
A NAND device is logically organised as one or more
<emphasis>partitions</emphasis>, which are
usually set up by the relevant platform HAL.
You need to tell the mount command
which device and partition you wish to access. In the following example,
we are mounting partition 0 of the <emphasis>onboard</emphasis> NAND device.
</para>
<!-- FIXME: Update if partition naming is changed. -->

<programlisting>
rv = mount("onboard/0", "/nand", "yaffs");
</programlisting>

<note><para>The <emphasis>device</emphasis> argument to the
<function>mount</function> call is a NAND-specific device name, not
an entry in /dev.
Refer to the documentation for your platform HAL for details of how
the NAND device(s) are named, and to the NAND library documentation
for details of how partitions are addressed.
</para></note>

<para>
You can, if you wish, make the filesystem mounting automatic at
static constructor time with the MTAB_ENTRY macro. (Your platform
HAL may already do this; check it carefully.)
</para>

<programlisting>
MTAB_ENTRY(my_nand, "/nand", "yaffs", "onboard/0", "", 0);
</programlisting>

<note><para>This example is for eCosPro. In eCos, the MTAB_ENTRY macro
takes only four arguments.</para></note>

<sect3 id="yaffs-mount-options"><title>Mount-time options</title>
<para>
eCosPro allows various options to be passed to a filesystem at mount time,
by combining them with the filesystem argument in a particular format.
YAFFS understands the following options:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><constant>reserved</constant>=&lt;int&gt; The number of
physical NAND blocks to reserve for garbage collection and block failures
(minimum 2).  The default is set in CDL as
<constant>CYGNUM_FS_YAFFS_RESERVED_BLOCKS</constant>.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><constant>caches</constant>=&lt;int&gt; The number of
page cache entries to use.
Values of 10 to 20 are recommended.
The default is set in CDL as 
<constant>CYGNUM_FS_YAFFS_SHORTOP_CACHES</constant>.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><constant>skip-checkpoint-read</constant> Instructs YAFFS
to not attempt to reload the filesystem from a checkpoint, if one exists.
In other words, this option forces a full filesystem scan whether or not
one is necessary.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</sect3>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="yaffs-sync"><title>Data flushing</title>
<para>
YAFFS operates a cacheing layer in order to save undue wear on the
NAND chip if many small writes are performed. Because of this, 
if you wish to ensure that any data written to a still-open file has
been fully flushed, you must make a synchronisation request. This is
done with the <function>fsync</function> function, which takes as its
argument the file descriptor of the file you wish to synchronise.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="yaffs-checkpointing"><title>Checkpointing</title>
<para>
When mounting a filesystem, YAFFS has to scan the NAND chip to recreate
its internal state. This can be a slow process, but is made much
faster if there is a valid <emphasis>checkpoint</emphasis>.
</para>

<para>
A checkpoint is written out automatically when you unmount the filesystem.
At any other time, you can manually force a checkpoint to be written
with one of the following functions:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><function>cyg_fs_fssync(mountpoint)</function> 
synchronises a filesystem (automatically called on umount)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><function>sync</function> synchronises all mounted
filesystems.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<note><para>
A checkpoint becomes invalid as soon as there have been any other writes
to the filesystem. Finding a good place to sync is necessarily dependent
on your application logic.</para>
</note>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="yaffs-limitations"><title>Limitations</title>
<para>
Although YAFFS is a Unix-compatible filesystem, the eCos port does not
provide support for the full range of Unix attributes.
</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para> eCos does not check file or directory permissions;
everything it creates is given fixed user and group IDs of zero and
standard permissions (files rw-r--r--, directories rwxr-xr-x).</para></listitem>
<listitem><para> It is not currently possible to change file ownership
or permissions.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para> It is not currently possible to create symbolic links,
FIFOs (named pipes), sockets or device nodes.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para> Hard links to files work in the expected way. Hard
links to directories are forbidden.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para> It is not possible to unlink the '.', '..' or
'lost+found' special directories.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<note><para>
If you will be sharing a YAFFS filesystem between eCos and some other
operating system, you are advised to carefully check the other system's
definitions of mode (permission) bits and whether any translation may be
required.</para>
</note>
</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="yaffs-mem-reqs"><title>Memory requirements</title>
<para>
The amount of RAM required by YAFFS to hold its in-memory data structures
grows with the number of objects (files and directories) in your
filesystem.
You are recommended to test your application thoroughly to ensure
that sufficient memory exists for YAFFS to operate with the
most complicated filesystem it is likely to encounter.</para>

<para>
If you wish to estimate your RAM usage, the YAFFS author provides the
following calculation:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para> The partition itself requires a yaffs_DeviceStruct of 3608
bytes.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para> If CYGNUM_FS_YAFFS_SHORTOP_CACHES is enabled, each
is the size of a NAND page plus 28 bytes.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para> Every object (file, directory or hardlink) in the
filesystem takes a yaffs_Object struct, which is 124 bytes.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para> Every page of every file requires a Tnode entry, but
they are always allocated in groups of 16 at a time.</para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para>The size of a single Tnode entry is the
    number of <emphasis>bits</emphasis> required to number all the
    pages in the NAND partition YAFFS is using, numbering from
    <emphasis>one</emphasis>; this is rounded up to a multiple of 2,
    and has an absolute minimum of sixteen bits.</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>For example: on a partition with 65536 pages,
    seventeen bits are required for the numbering, which round up to
    18. Therefore each file takes 288 bits (36 bytes) per group of Tnodes,
    and one group of Tnodes will cover up to sixteen pages of data.</para></listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<note><para><emphasis>Actual memory consumption will be slightly
higher than suggested by the above.</emphasis> This arises from the
tree structure holding the Tnodes, overheads from the heap itself,
and so on.</para></note>

<para>
YAFFS calls the standard <function>malloc</function> function to allocate
memory and <function>free</function> to release it.  Normally, the eCos
heap occupies all spare RAM not needed for the program, its static
data or the stacks. Therefore, most applications will not need to do
anything special beyond ensuring there is enough spare RAM available on
the platform.</para>

<tip><para>
If you wish to experiment with restricted-size heaps to determine
much memory your application actually uses under YAFFS,
you may find the option
<constant>CYGSEM_MEMALLOC_INVOKE_OUT_OF_MEMORY</constant> of use.
</para></tip>

<sect2 id="yaffs-mem-reqs-example"><title>Worked example</title>
<para>
Consider a YAFFS filesystem hosted by a NAND partition with 65536 pages,
each of size 2k, using the default setting of ten short-op caches.
On this filesystem we shall store 10000 files each of
size 10240 bytes, hence each requires a single group of Tnodes.

<para>
This example is a close match to the actual consumption measured by 
eCosCentric during testing. (The measured consumption as reported 
by <function>mallinfo</function> was 1,681,112 bytes, which includes
the heap's own overheads.)

<sect1 id="yaffs-testing"><title>Testing</title>
<para>
YAFFS is supplied with a number of test programs, some of which are have been
adapted from tests for other filesystems in eCos.
</para>

<glosslist>
<glossentry><glossterm>fops</glossterm><glossdef><para>
This was the first basic test created for the port of the filesystem.
It is believed to exercise all of the code paths (filesystem operations,
file operations and directory operations) within the eCos-YAFFS
adaptation layer.  </para> <para>
This test was originally intended to run on a synthetic NAND filesystem.
On real NAND chips, it deliberately omits the more stressful routines to
avoid undue wear on the hardware.
</para></glossdef></glossentry>
<glossentry><glossterm>yaffs1</glossterm><glossdef><para>
A number of filesystem edge-case semantic tests, including 
file and directory creation and deletion, 
invalid open and rename operations, and
removing nonexistent files and directories.
</para></glossdef></glossentry>
<glossentry><glossterm>yaffs2</glossterm><glossdef><para>
Concurrent multi-threaded filesystem access and consistency checks.
</para></glossdef></glossentry>
<glossentry><glossterm>yaffs4</glossterm><glossdef><para>
Semantic and edge-case testing - like yaffs1 - but with long file names.
</para></glossdef></glossentry>
<glossentry><glossterm>yaffs5</glossterm><glossdef><para>
Tests that file reading and writing works over reasonably large files
(up to 1Mbyte) with different I/O chunk sizes. Some operation timings
are collected and reported, as is the data rate on large files.
</para></glossdef></glossentry>
<glossentry><glossterm>yaffs6</glossterm><glossdef><para>
Semantic and edge-case testing - like yaffs1 - but with Cyrillic filenames
in order to test UTF-8 correctness.
</para></glossdef></glossentry>
<glossentry><glossterm>mounttime</glossterm><glossdef><para>
A simple benchmark which repeatedly mounts and unmounts the filesystem
and measures how long this takes.
You can optionally use the <filename>mkfiles</filename> routine - also
present in the tests directory - to create many short files so you can 
test performance on a loaded filesystem.
</para></glossdef></glossentry>
<glossentry><glossterm>hammer</glossterm><glossdef><para>
A stress test designed to shake out corner cases.
Repeatedly creates many files of varying sizes from multiple threads
until the filesystem fills up, then verifies their contents and removes
them. From time to time, all threads pause and the filesystem is
unmounted and remounted. </para><para>This test is particularly useful when 
combined with the bad block injection functionality provided by
the synthetic NAND device. It has been used in this way by eCosCentric to

<chapter id="yaffs-redboot"><title>Using YAFFS with RedBoot</title>
<para>
It is possible to link YAFFS into RedBoot and use it to boot an
executable image stored on a NAND array. 
</para>

<para>
This is done by configuring and building RedBoot largely in the normal way.
You will need to add <filename>CYGPKG_FS_YAFFS</filename> and
<filename>CYGPKG_IO_FILEIO</filename> to your configuration, plus their
attendant dependencies.
</para>

<para>
The presence of CYGPKG_IO_FILEIO activates the <filename>fs</filename> series
of RedBoot commands. The following (edited) transcript illustrates how
they might
be used in concert with other RedBoot commands to store an ELF image on
a NAND partition, load it back and execute:
</para>

<programlisting>
RedBoot> fs mount -d onboard/0 -t yaffs /nand
yaffs: restored from checkpoint
RedBoot> load -r -h my.tftp.ip.address -b %{freememlo} my.image
Using default protocol (TFTP)
Raw file loaded 0xa013f000-0xa01554b3, assumed entry at 0xa013f000
RedBoot> fs write /nand/myimg.elf
RedBoot> fs list /nand                                                          
   1 drwxr-xr-x  0 size      0 .
   1 drwxr-xr-x  0 size      0 ..
 262 -rw-r--r--  0 size  91316 myimg.elf
   2 drwxr-xr-x  0 size      0 lost+found
RedBoot> load -m file /nand/myimg.elf
RedBoot> go
Hello, NAND world!
</programlisting>

<note><para>When you command RedBoot to execute an image, it 
first synchronises all mounted filesystems. Therefore,
provided these filesystems support the synchronisation operation
(which YAFFS does), it is not always necessary to unmount them before
invoking an image.
</para>
</note>

<sect1 id="yaffs-rb-mem"><title>Memory considerations under RedBoot</title>
<para>
RedBoot traditionally has very limited requirements for memory management;
the main need is for there to be free space in RAM at the correct
(physical) address to load an image before jumping to it.
</para>

<para>
Introducing YAFFS brings with it not just the need to have dynamically
allocatable RAM (<filename>CYGPKG_MEMALLOC</filename>), but enough
to replay the filesystem journal. This must be balanced against the need
for RAM to load images into.
</para>

<para>
When the <filename>CYGPKG_MEMALLOC</filename> package is present in
RedBoot, by default a small (64k) heap is set up so that the maximum RAM
possible is available for loading images. This is not enough to 
support YAFFS in any circumstances, so the following definition has
been included in the <filename>yaffs.cdl</filename> file:
</para>

<programlisting>
requires        { CYGPKG_REDBOOT implies (CYGMEM_REDBOOT_WORKSPACE_HEAP_SIZE >= 0x00014000) }
</programlisting>

<caution><para>
This declaration only provideds the bare minimum heap required to mount a 
trivial YAFFS filesystem. More will be required for all but the simplest
of cases and it is recommended that you test for typical use in your
environment. Refer also to <xref linkend="yaffs-mem-reqs">.
</para></caution>

<para>
It is recommended that, should you wish to make a filesystem usable by
RedBoot, your platform HAL should make a similar
declaration in its CDL to establish an appropriate heap size.

For example, the platform HAL for the EA LPC2468 OEM board - which has
a 128MB NAND chip on-board - contains the following declaration:
</para>

<programlisting>
requires        { (CYGPKG_REDBOOT && CYGPKG_FS_YAFFS) implies (CYGMEM_REDBOOT_WORKSPACE_HEAP_SIZE >= 0x20000) }
</programlisting>

<tip><para>
If you wish to experiment with restricted heaps to determine
much memory your application actually uses under YAFFS,
you may find the option
<constant>CYGSEM_MEMALLOC_INVOKE_OUT_OF_MEMORY</constant> of use.
</para></tip>
